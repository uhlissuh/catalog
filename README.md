# Sports n' Things Catalog Project

This catalog was built to satisfy the requirements of Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree Project 5. I used the Flask microframework to build the back end and implemented Google's Oauth2 authentication system. I threw in some barebones styling with Bootstrap.

##  Run Locally
1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
2. Clone this project
3. Clone the Vagrantfile from Udacity's fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository
4. Launch the Vagrant VM (vagrant up)

At the terminal, run

```sh
python server.py
